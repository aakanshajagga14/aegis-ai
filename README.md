# Consent Layer

> **"This is what you actually agreed to."**

Consent Layer translates complex privacy policies and terms of service into clear, human-readable consent signals — showing users what they give up, what's unclear, and who benefits more from the agreement.

## What It Does

Most people click "I Agree" without reading a word. Platforms design it that way. Consent Layer breaks that pattern by analyzing any privacy policy and surfacing three signals instantly:

- 🔴 **What You Lose** — data collection, third-party sharing, broad permissions
- 🟡 **What's Unclear** — vague language, undefined parties, buried opt-outs
- 🟢 **What's Safe** — explicit user rights, opt-out mechanisms, transparency commitments

Plus a **Benefit Balance Indicator** — a visual score showing who the agreement actually favors.

## Demo

The app ships with a fully working demo using a fictional platform called **Vela Social** — no API keys, no setup, works offline.

Click **"Analyze Consent"** and watch the full analysis cascade in real time.

## How the Demo Flow Works

When you click **Analyze Consent**, a carefully timed sequence plays out:

1. **Scanning phase (1.5s)** — status messages cycle through fake processing steps, CLI-style
2. **Results cascade** — each category reveals line by line, 300ms stagger
3. **Red flag callouts** — exact policy quotes surface with a crimson left border
4. **Balance bar** — animates outward from center, landing on the final score

Total flow: **6–8 seconds**. Designed for live demos and presentations.

## The Benefit Balance Bar

The most unique feature. Not a moral judgment — just transparency.

```
You  [███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  Platform
      28%                72%
```

Calculated from volume of data collected, scope of permissions granted, and degree of user control retained. Animates on reveal.

## Design Decisions

This UI was built to **not look AI-generated**. Specific choices made:

- No default Tailwind palette — custom near-monochrome base with three intentional accent colors
- No glassmorphism, gradients, or floating blobs
- Space Grotesk over the generic Inter/Roboto default
- Editorial layout — left input panel, right live results — feels like a terminal meets a legal brief
- Red flag quotes rendered in monospace, like pulled evidence, not UI cards

---

## What's Next

- **Real Claude API integration** — live analysis of any policy URL
- **Chrome Extension** — analyze any site with one click
- **Policy Change Tracking** — historical diffs when ToS updates
- **Accessibility Mode** — simplified language for non-technical users
- **Parental Consent View** — child-safe summaries for younger users

---

## Why This Matters

The average person has agreed to thousands of privacy policies they've never read. Platforms make them long and opaque on purpose — obscurity is a feature, not a bug.

Consent Layer is built on one idea: **transparency should be the default**. Every person who clicks "I Agree" deserves to know what that actually means for their data, their rights, and their digital footprint.

## License

MIT — because consent should be mutual.
